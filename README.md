docker-postgres-backups
=======================

Uses `pg_dump` to dump a postgresDB, encrypts with PGP and uploads to S3.
It does also cleanup old backups.

#### Schedules
It does a backup every
- 5 Minutes to the folder ./latest 
- hour to the folder ./hourly
- day to the folder ./daily

#### Clenup
It removes old backups on s3 in the following way
- latest-backups: older than 3 hours
- hourly-backups: older than a day
- daily-backups: older than 3 months

#### Encryption
The public-key for gpg should be placed inside a directory and mounted as a 
volume into the container.
